## Introduction

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is a powerful framework for developing robot software, providing the necessary tools, libraries, and conventions to develop robot applications quickly and efficiently. This repository is designed to offer structured tutorials and examples that will help you learn ROS 2 step-by-step.

## Getting Started

To get started with these tutorials, you should have ROS 2 installed on your system. We recommend using [ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) or a later version. Installation guides for ROS 2 can be found on the official [ROS 2 documentation site](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming (preferably in Python and/or C++).
- Familiarity with Linux-based systems (Ubuntu is recommended).
- ROS 2 installed on your system ([installation instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)).

## Tutorials Overview

### Beginner Level

The beginner tutorials will cover the fundamentals of ROS 2 and provide a solid foundation for understanding the core concepts. Topics include:

- **Installing ROS 2**: Step-by-step guide to installing ROS 2.
- **ROS 2 Basics**: Nodes, topics, services, and parameters.
- **Writing Your First Node**: Creating a simple publisher and subscriber in Python and C++.
- **Using ROS 2 Tools**: Introduction to `rviz2`, `gazebo`, `rqt`, and other essential ROS 2 tools.
- **Building and Running Packages**: Using `colcon` to build and manage ROS 2 packages.

### Intermediate Level

These tutorials will dive deeper into ROS 2 features and tools, covering more complex tasks and projects.

- **Action Servers and Clients**: Implementing action-based communication.
- **Using `tf2` for Transformations**: Working with the transform library.
- **Robot Simulation**: Setting up and using Gazebo for robot simulation.
